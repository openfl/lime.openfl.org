Lime.OpenFL.org
===============

This is the source for https://lime.openfl.org.

You can build the site using [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com). It should work in a Unix environment, either from Linux, macOS or the Ubuntu Bash Shell for Windows. Make sure that Ruby is installed, and install Bundler (`gem install bundler`), then run the following in the openfl.org directory:

	bundle install
	bundle exec jekyll serve

Thanks for using Lime!
