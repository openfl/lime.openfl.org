title: Setup Firefox OS
---

Mozilla has ended support for Firefox OS.

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for Firefox OS.

## Manual Install

No additional tools to build for Firefox OS.

To test an application in the Firefox OS Simulator, or to push an application to a device, you must install the [Firefox OS App Manager](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/) as an extension to a standard Firefox browser desktop install.

You can find more information about working with the App Manager [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager).
