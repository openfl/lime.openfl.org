BlackBerry ended support for BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry OS on January 4, 2022.

## Automatic Install

Open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command:

    lime setup blackberry

## Manual Install

Lime is compatible with the BlackBerry Tablet SDK, which enables support for legacy BlackBerry PlayBook devices as well as BlackBerry 10:

 * [Windows](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/fetch/installer-bbndk-2.1.0-win32-1032-201209271809-201209280007.exe)
 * [macOS](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/fetch/installer-bbndk-2.1.0-macosx-1032-201209271809-201209280007.dmg)
 * [Linux](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads/fetch/installer-bbndk-2.1.0-linux-1032-201209271809-201209280007.bin)

You can also use newer BlackBerry Native SDKs, which support BlackBerry 10 devices only.

Open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command:

    lime setup blackberry

When prompted to automatically download and install the Native SDK, type "n" and press enter. Afterward, it will instead prompt for where it is installed. Type the location of your BlackBerry Native SDK, and press enter.
