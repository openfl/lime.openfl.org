## Automatic Install

Open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command:

    lime setup tizen

## Manual Install

In order to build applications for Tizen, you will need the Tizen 2.2 SDK installed. Lime uses native C++ to target Tizen, so during the install process, make sure that native components are selected:

 * [Tizen SDK](https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/tizen-sdk)

Open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command:

    lime setup tizen

When prompted to open the address for the Tizen SDK, type "n" and press enter. Afterward, it should prompt for where it has been installed. Type the location where you installed the Tizen SDK and press enter.
